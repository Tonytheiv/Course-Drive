abstract = {The two main properties related to heat conduction are thermal conductivity (K) and thermal diffusivity (D). However, while the meaning of K is very well known, the role played by D is usually undervalued and misunderstood. In this paper we will try to clarify the meaning of thermal diffusivity, first in homogeneous materials and then in composite materials. In this latter case, we will find that sometimes the association of two good thermal diffusers gives a bad diffuser. Moreover, by properly choosing the constituents of the composites we can manufacture materials with thermal properties that are not found in nature.}

    abstract = "{A modified Ångström method for measuring thermal diffusivity and hence thermal conductivity of metals has been developed. Like previously reported dynamic methods, this method uses a heat source, whose temperature varies sinusoidally with time, located at one end of an effectively infinite rod. Unlike these methods, only one period of the heat pulse is required to eliminate the unknown coefficient determining the heat lost by radiation since both velocity and amplitude decrement of the heat pulse are measured. In addition to providing greater reliability at high temperatures by using only one period, the new method is faster in taking data and simpler in computation. The thermoelectric potentials from two thermojunctions are amplified and plotted on a Brown electronic recorder in order to obtain a permanent record of all necessary data for computing the thermal diffusivity. Results for copper, nickel, and thorium over the temperature range 0–500°C are given.}",
