    abstract = "{We point out that current textbooks of modern physics are a century out-of-date in their treatment of blackbody radiation within classical physics. Relativistic classical electrodynamics including classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation gives the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation as the blackbody radiation spectrum. In contrast, nonrelativistic mechanics cannot support the idea of zero-point energy; therefore, if nonrelativistic classical statistical mechanics or nonrelativistic mechanical scatterers are invoked for radiation equilibrium, one arrives at only the low-frequency Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectrum, which involves no zero-point energy, and does not include the high-frequency part of the spectrum involving relativistically invariant classical zero-point radiation. Here, we first discuss the correct understanding of blackbody radiation within relativistic classical physics, and then we review the historical treatment. Finally, we point out how the presence of Lorentz-invariant classical zero-point radiation and the use of relativistic particle interactions transform the previous historical arguments, so as now to give the Planck spectrum including classical zero-point radiation. Within relativistic classical electromagnetic theory, Planck's constant ℏ appears as the scale of source-free zero-point radiation.}",

abstract = {We investigate the time-dependent spectrum of light from an observational point of view and define a time-dependent ``physical spectrum'' of light based on the counting rate of a photodetector. The tunable element, the filter, that allows observation of different spectral components of the light is shown to play an essential role in the time-dependent spectrum. Its bandwidth cannot be taken arbitrarily narrow. We establish the connection between our physical spectrum and other time-dependent spectra associated with Page, Lampard, Silverman, and Kolmogorov, as well as with the Wiener-Khintchine power spectrum. Also, we show the conditions under which these earlier definitions can be used as the first approximations to the complete physical spectrum, and give an expression for the correction terms.},

In many cases, the total power dissipated by the lamp is well described by a sum of two power-law terms, with one exponent very close to 4, as predicted by the radiation law, and the other very close to 1, as for simple heat conduction. This result was true even for filament surfaces with a shiny metallic appearance, whose emissivity should vary with temperature.}",
