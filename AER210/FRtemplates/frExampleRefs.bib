abstract = {This paper will show that so-called “Newton’s law of cooling” that is often used for calculating of heat transfer by convection is actually not a law, but a model of heat exchange (heat transfer). Limits of validity of this law were discovered and will be shown. Moreover, an existing practice of modernizing this law for the purpose of calculating convective heat transfer will be questioned.}
